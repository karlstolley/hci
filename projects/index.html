        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create a compelling single-page site that features a sign-up process to get new
          users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
          open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of
          interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering, which is
          not an easy task. Design for effortless, engaging entry of personal information. Include
          friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete
          information.

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write only one valid well-formed HTML file, one valid CSS file, and one JavaScript file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encode source files in UTF-8/Unicode with Unix-style line endings (LF); entab with
            spaces, not tab characters
          </li>
          <li>
            Indent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with 2 spaces per level of indent. Indent HTML
            when nesting tags. Indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further
            indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries. Indent inside of all blocks in
            JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Present organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring. Challenge yourself to use native DOM methods first.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run all code through validators and linters to ensure the quality of your HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>HTML requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Use the default-served <code>index.html</code> file name in directory-based URLs, so
                that you can point to, for example, <code>example.com/</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Write well-formed, valid semantic HTML. Projects whose HTML does not validate with
                the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> will receive a
                zero-point, failing grade. In the unlikely event that you discover a validation
                error or warning that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must acknowledge that
                bug in the memo that accompanies your project, and point to the relevant
                documentation, such as specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your
                source is in fact correct. Get in the habit of validating and linting your HTML
                before you commit to Git.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use only structural, semantic HTML elements and attributes. <b>Absolutely no</b>
                table markup, break tags, or any other use of HTML to achieve a particular page
                layout. All layout and design should be handled via CSS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write valid HTML form elements in conjunction with <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags
                and the <code>for</code> attribute
              </li>
              <li>
                Present semantically structured text-based content to accompany all media elements
                (image, audio, video). Make use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>CSS requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Write one single valid, linted, error-free CSS file called <code>screen.css</code>.
                <b>Do not</b> create more than one CSS file for your project; all styles should be
                in the same file.
              </li>
              <li>
                Open <code>screen.css</code> with <a href="https://gist.github.com/profstolley/b1f851e061f98fcbc0e41d39adc32847#file-_reset-min-css">the minified Eric Meyer reset CSS</a>

              </li>
              <li>
                Use only relative units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vw</code>,
                <code>%</code>) in your CSS; no <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, or other absolute
                units are permitted in your CSS
              </li>
              <li>
                Use only <code>min-width</code> media queries to enhance your mobile-first
                styles for larger screens
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Use JavaScript only for progressive enhancement. All site content and basic
                functionality (e.g., clicking links, viewing images and other media, scrolling,
                submitting forms) must still be accessible even in the absence of JavaScript.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Never use</b> <code>on-</code> or other deprecated event attributes in your
                HTML. Handle all events via event listeners in your JavaScript. The only element in
                your HTML that should contain any references to JavaScript should be a
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly
                also your DOM-manipulation framework. In other words, keep your JavaScript
                unobtrusive to progressively enhance your HTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit JavaScript to
                manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and keep style
                information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use an immedately invoked function expression (IIFE), function closures, and other
                techniques to avoid polluting the global <code>window</code> namespace

              <li>
                Build a Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that

        <h3>Project Two: Booking System Design</h3>
        <small>Due Thursday, April 18, 11:59pm&nbsp;CT</small>
      </header>
      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, you will work in self-selected teams of three or four students to design
          a booking system for purchasing tickets for travel, movies, concerts, or sporting events,
          or a similar system for ordering food online.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all of those types of systems, users must be able to book a purchase for a certain
          number of people, for a certain event taking place at a particular time. There are then
          also the details like the destination for a flight, bus, or train; or the specific movie
          or concert. And finally there is the problem of reserving a specific seat or a block of
          options: seating charts to clarify which seats someone is purchasing, or a menu displaying
          food items available for order. You must also design a simple form for accepting payment
          by credit card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your design, which you will test with actual users for Project Three, must accomodate all
          of those kinds of choices and others that you identify. You should begin by conducting a
          competitive task-analysis of other, similar booking sites. Take extensive notes of the
          patterns that you see. Which work? Which could be improved upon? And what entirely new
          ideas do you and your team have for streamlining the user experience of these types of
          multifacted tasks?

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct task analysis and apply the information gained to a user-centered design</li>
          <li>
            Build interface modules/elements from a basic design foundation of alignment, contrast,
            proximity, and repetition
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and
            grid-based design
          </li>
          <li>
            Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused
            on system users and tasks

        <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Whole team: A project proposal, based in part on your work for Production Problem 03,
            describing:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Who the members are on your team (organize yourselves on Basecamp starting 3/4)
              </li>
              <li>What kind of booking system you will build</li>
              <li>
                What the URL is to your shared team GitHub repository, and the URLs to each team
                member’s individual fork of the shared repository
              </li>
              <li>
                Which project-management/communication app (e.g., Basecamp, Slack, Trello, or
                something else) that you will use to communicate with one another to coordinate your
                work and avoid disasters on GitHub and elsewhere.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The proposal should be collaboratively written as a Markdown file in your shared GitHub
            repository (due no later than Thursday, March 14, 11:59pm CT). Designate one member of
            the group to post as a new message thread on Basecamp the URL to the group repo
            containing the proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whole team: A screen-by-screen task analysis of existing sites that provide similar
            functionality to your chosen task (again, e.g., booking a flight, purchasing
            reserved-seating tickets to a concert, ordering food for delivery at a specific time).
            Post to Basecamp (due no later than Thursday, March 28 11:59pm CT).

            Whole team: A video presentation of your team’s work in progress, hosted on YouTube,
            Vimeo, or another similar service and posted to Basecamp. Your Basecamp post should
            include the URL to your team’s GitHub repository and a URL to the live site (GitHub
            Pages is fine). Include in the text of your post one or two <b>specific</b> things you

                resets from class demos); consider also the Normalize.css styles for forms
              </li>
              <li>
                Only relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS; no px, pt, or other absolute
                units allowed (pixel units are allowed in media queries, although you may wish
                to convert those to 16px-based ems)
              </li>
              <li>
                Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for
                larger screens
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                JavaScript that throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively (no JavaScript
                event attributes in your HTML, in other words; attach events to any elements
                requiring interaction)
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript that uses function closures and other techniques to avoid polluting the
                global <code>window</code> namespace
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript that uses only asynchronous methods and callbacks
              </li>
              <li>
                Use of JavaScript objects or JSON to prototype interaction with a server to retrieve
                data, such as indicating seat/show/menu availability
              </li>
              <li>
                Use of cookies or, better, LocalStorage to maintain information/state between
                pages (e.g., the number of tickets someone wishes to purchase)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Git requirements:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Whole team: A shared team Git repository with frequent commits from each team member
                and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes. <b>The
                team GitHub repository must include frequent commits from every team member for the
                duration of the project.</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                Each team member: An individual Git repository with feature branches, frequent
                commits, and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes
                that you make, including experimental work that you ultimately might not push
                upstream to the shared group repository.
              </li>
              <li>
                All GitHub repositories (team and individual) must contain <b>only</b> the files and
                commits from this project
              </li>
              <li>
                Use of the command-line Git program on your computer; no commits made through the
                GitHub web interface, apart from merge commits created as part of code reviews/pull
                requests
              </li>

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s booking system project to
          a series of low-stakes user tests, and to develop and implement improvements to the
          project based on what you learn through your user tests.
        </p>

<!--
        <p>
          You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
          welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
          form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
          website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and
          tasks, obviously.

        <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike previous projects, your deliverables for this assignment should be turned in as a
          Google Drive share URL. Be sure all members of your group have full read/write access to
          the group folder on Drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do <b>not</b> use the internal sharing function on Drive with the instructor. Generate a
          shareable URL that you paste yourself into a Basecamp post or an email to the instructor.
          The URL should point to a folder containing thoughtfully named files and folders
          containing each deliverable listed below.
