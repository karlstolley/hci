        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create a compelling single-page site that features a sign-up process to get new
          users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
          open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal
          information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed,
          missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with
          patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
          offering, which is not at all an easy task.

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Project must be built with only one valid well-formed HTML file, one valid CSS file,
            and one JavaScript file.
          </li>
          <li>
            All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF),
            entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
          </li>
          <li>
            Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should all be indented with 2 spaces per level of
            indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all
            rules and blocks inside your media queries. Indent inside of all blocks in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of both the validators and linters to ensure the quality of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantically structured text-based content to accompany all media elements (image,
            audio, video). Make use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags
          </li>
          <li>
            One single valid, linted, error-free CSS file called <code>screen.css</code>. <b>Do
            not</b> create more than one CSS file for your project; all styles should be in the same
            file. Use an <code>id</code> value on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and leverage that in a CSS descendant selector if you need a
            special style on a particular page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening lines of your <code>screen.css</code> file should be the Eric Meyer reset
            CSS styles
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of only relative units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vm</code>,
            <code>%</code>) in your CSS; no <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, or other absolute
            units are permitted in your CSS
          </li>
          <li>
            Use at least three min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for
            larger screens
          </li>
          <li>
            Use JavaScript only for progressive enhancement. All site content and basic
            functionality (e.g., clicking links, viewing images and other media, scrolling,
            submitting forms) must still be available even in the absence of JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Absolutely no</b> <code>on-</code> or other deprecated event attributes in your HTML.
            Handle all events via event listeners in your JavaScript. The only element of your HTML
            that should contain any references to JavaScript should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly also your DOM-manipulation
            framework. In other words, keep your JavaScript unobtrusive to progressively enhance
            your HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit JavaScript to
            manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and keep style
            information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately
            reflect each set of changes that you make
          </li>
          <li>
            Your GitHub repository must contain ONLY the files and commits from this project

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking, credit card
          payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or
          workers. Self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign a bad portal site. Your
          redesigned portal should be designed and developed according to sound principles of
          human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

        <h3>Project Three: User-Tested, Revised Web Portal</h3>

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s Web Portal Redesign
          project to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to suggest improvements to the Web
          Portal Redesign project based on what you learn through your user tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
          welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
          form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
          website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and
          tasks, obviously.
