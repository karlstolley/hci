        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create a compelling single-page site that features a sign-up process to get new
          users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an
          open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal
          information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed,
          missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with
          patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re
          offering, which is not at all an easy task.

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Project must be built with only one valid well-formed HTML file, one valid CSS file,
            and one JavaScript file.
          </li>
          <li>
            All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF),
            entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
          </li>
          <li>
            Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should all be indented with 2 spaces per level of
            indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all
            rules and blocks inside your media queries. Indent inside of all blocks in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of both the validators and linters to ensure the quality of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantically structured text-based content to accompany all media elements (image,
            audio, video). Make use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags
          </li>
          <li>
            One single valid, linted, error-free CSS file called <code>screen.css</code>. <b>Do
            not</b> create more than one CSS file for your project; all styles should be in the same
            file. Use an <code>id</code> value on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and leverage that in a CSS descendant selector if you need a
            special style on a particular page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening lines of your <code>screen.css</code> file should be the Eric Meyer reset
            CSS styles
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of only relative units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vm</code>,
            <code>%</code>) in your CSS; no <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, or other absolute
            units are permitted in your CSS
          </li>
          <li>
            Use at least three min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for
            larger screens
          </li>
          <li>
            Use JavaScript only for progressive enhancement. All site content and basic
            functionality (e.g., clicking links, viewing images and other media, scrolling,
            submitting forms) must still be available even in the absence of JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Absolutely no</b> <code>on-</code> or other deprecated event attributes in your HTML.
            Handle all events via event listeners in your JavaScript. The only element of your HTML
            that should contain any references to JavaScript should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly also your DOM-manipulation
            framework. In other words, keep your JavaScript unobtrusive to progressively enhance
            your HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit JavaScript to
            manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and keep style
            information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately
            reflect each set of changes that you make
          </li>
          <li>

        <h3>Project Two: Booking System Design</h3>
        <small>Due Thursday, April 5, 11:59pm&nbsp;CT</small>
      </header>
      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, you will work in self-selected teams of three or four students to design
          a booking system for purchasing tickets for travel, movies, concerts, or sporting events,
          or a similar system for ordering food online.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all of those types of systems, users must be able to book a purchase for a certain
          number of people, for a certain event taking place at a particular time. There are then
          also the details like the destination for a flight, bus, or train; or the specific movie
          or concert. And finally there is the problem of reserving a specific seat or a block of
          seats: seating charts to clarify what seats someone is purchasing, or a menu displaying
          food items available for order. You must also design a simple form for accepting payment
          by credit card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your design, which you will test with actual users for Project Three, must accomodate all
          of those kinds of choices and others that you identify. You should begin by conducting a
          competitive task-analysis of other, similar booking sites. Take extensive notes of the
          patterns that you see. Which work? Which could be improved upon? And what entirely new
          ideas do you and your team have for streamlining the user experience of these types of
          multifacted tasks?
        </p>

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct task analysis and apply the information gained to a user-centered design</li>
          <li>
            Build interface modules/elements from a basic design foundation of alignment, contrast,
            proximity, and repetition
          </li>

        <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Whole team: A project proposal, based in part on your work for Production Problem 02,
            describing:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Who the members are on your team (organize yourselves on Basecamp starting 2/19)
              </li>
              <li>What kind of booking system you will build</li>
              <li>
                What the URL is to your shared team GitHub repository, and the URLs to each team
                member’s individual fork of the shared repository
              </li>
              <li>
                Which project-management/communication app (e.g., Basecamp, Slack, Trello, or
                something else) that you will use to communicate with one another to coordinate your
                work and avoid disasters on GitHub and elsewhere.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The proposal should be collaboratively written as a Markdown file in your shared GitHub
            repository (due no later than Sunday, February 25, 11:59pm CT). Designate one member of
            the group to post as a new message thread on Basecamp the URL to the group repo
            containing the proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whole team: A screen-by-screen task analysis of existing sites that provide similar
            functionality to your chosen task (again, e.g., booking a flight, purchasing
            reserved-seating tickets to a concert, ordering food for delivery at a specific time).
            Post to Basecamp (due no later than Sunday, March 4, 11:59pm CT).
          </li>
          <li>
            Whole team: A video presentation of your team’s work in progress, hosted on YouTube,
            Vimeo, or another similar service and posted to Basecamp. Your Basecamp post should
            include the URL to your team’s GitHub repository and a URL to the live site (GitHub
            Pages is fine). Include in the text of your post one or two <b>specific</b> things you

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s booking system project to
          a series of low-stakes user tests, and to develop and implement improvements to the
          project based on what you learn through your user tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are
          welcome to use as a starting point his sample script and recording release
          form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s
          website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your specific project and
          tasks, obviously.
