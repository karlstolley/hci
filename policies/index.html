      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        <b>From the Catalog:</b> Students in this course will learn the importance of
        human-computer interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The
        course will cover a survey of methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as
        usability testing and prototyping, as well as general design principles and how to use
        design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on usability for Web site
        engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design and
        construction of user-centered Web sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Extended Description:</b> Additionally, this course favors a mobile-first approach to
        web design and development, with special attention to the challenges of designing
        touch-screen interfaces. Students will learn development methods based on prototyping and
        rapid iteration, supported by version control and low-stakes user-testing. The design
        principles the course will emphasize include color, material design, rich web typography,
        and responsive grid-based page layout. Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and
        thoughtful, thoroughly researched use of edge technologies and polyfills will be treated
        as guiding techniques throughout the course. Student work is organized around projects of
        varying size and scale, emphasizing the course’s hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web
        design and development.
      </p>

    <section id="assignments">
      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All major projects for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
        karl.stolley@gmail.com Draft work will be posted to Basecamp for feedback from the
        instructor and others in the class. Emails should <b>never</b> include email attachments,
        but rather GitHub URLs pointing to either your project’s Git repository or a particular file
        or commit that is causing you problems. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>All HTML in project and Production Problem submissions must pass validation</b> with the
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>. Any work whose HTML
        does not validate will receive a zero-point, failing grade. In the unlikely event that you
        discover a validation error or warning that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must
        acknowledge that bug in the email that accompanies your project, and point to the relevant
        documentation, such as specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your source
        is in fact correct. Get in the habit of validating and linting your HTML before you commit
        your work to Git.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in
        each project description. <b>My deadlines, including for draft work, are no different from
        exam dates in classes that have exams.</b> Treat deadlines accordingly. Weekly work, such as
        the Production Problems and discussion posts, is due before the start of the first class
        meeting each week.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Your active participation in class and in Basecamp discussions and chats is required both for
        your own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not give
        reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to be prepared to discuss
        that reading, especially on Basecamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        A participation grade of A means you’re regularly posting to Basecamp 3 or more times per
        week, and that your posts include good questions. A grade of B means you’re posting 1-2
        times a week. A C is a post per week, and anything less than that is a failing, zero grade
        for participation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living, so it’s unsurprising that
        it is also essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command
        various technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
        acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it
        is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage all
        students to contact me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you
        contact me via Basecamp Ping or email well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
        up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
        is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
        important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
        before a project is due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
        accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
        certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
        also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a
        collaborator, for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high
        value of establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias.
        Public accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your
        online presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when
        they look for you on Google and elsewhere.

    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>. All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
        a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
        Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
        violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

      <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
      <p>
        I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all
        students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented
        disabilities. In order to receive formal accommodations, students must obtain a letter of
        accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a
        href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower,
        3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at

      </p>
      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
