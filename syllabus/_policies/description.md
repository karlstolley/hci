title: Course Description
---

<b>From the Catalog:</b> This course will cover the creation of Web pages and sites using HTML, CSS,
Javascript, jQuery, and graphical [sic] applications as well as the client and server architecture
of the Internet and related web technologies. The creation and deployment of modern,
standards-compliant web pages are addressed. Students create and deploy a Web site with multiple
pages and cross-linked structures.

<b>Extended Description:</b> The course emphasizes a research-driven approach to web development
that adheres to the relevant standards specifications governing the use of the web’s languages and
protocols. All practices covered in this class give priority to accessibility and long-term use and
sustainability. The course avoids entirely the lore and half-baked, quick-fix shortcuts that too
often plague web development practice and instruction. Student work is organized around weekly work
and participation, and three major projects, completed both individually or possibly in teams. All
projects emphasize the course’s hands-on, theory-grounded approach to web development.
