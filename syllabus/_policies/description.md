<b>From the Catalog:</b> Students in this course will learn the importance of human-computer
interaction design and the effectiveness of user-centered design. The course will cover a survey of
methods frequently used by the HCI profession, such as usability testing and prototyping, as well as
general design principles and how to use design guidelines. A particular emphasis will be placed on
usability for Web site engineering, and students will apply knowledge from the field in the design
and construction of user-centered Web sites.

<b>Extended Description:</b> Additionally, this course favors a mobile-first approach to responsive
web design and development, with special attention to the challenges of designing touch-screen
interfaces. Students will learn test-driven development methods supported by prototyping, rapid
iteration, version control, and low-stakes user-testing. The design principles the course will
emphasize include color, rich web typography, and responsive grid-based page layout, executed in
modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid).

Accessibility, progressive enhancement, and inclusive design will be treated as guiding principles
throughout the course. Student work is organized around active participation in electronic
discussions, and three major projects, completed both individually and in teams.
