title: Books
comment: >
  <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> It’s important to acquire and read the edition indicated for
  each book, and I only assign newer editions when the content warrants it. The total retail price
  tag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $118 on the high end, but with
  discounts the total should be under $100). Each book should be worthy of a place on your
  bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the class has ended. I want to help you build
  your professional library while also being sensitive to your personal finances.
