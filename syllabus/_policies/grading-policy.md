### Extra Credit

Everybody knows that professors sit atop a mountain of extra-credit points, just waiting to
distribute them to students who screwed up when it came time to earn the run-of-the-mill *credit* in
the class. As a bonus, that *extra* credit is just extra, extra sweet. Way better than just doing
the actual credit-bearing work of the class. Amiright?

**Bad news: there is no extra credit in my classes.** Period. Tell your friends: Stolley is a big
mean jerk, keeping all of that extra credit for himself. Like he even needs it.

If you’re the kind of troubled student who really loves extra credit that much, create your own:
consider yourself as having a zero-point, failing grade in this class. Tough news on the first day,
I know. Your grade is in real, serious trouble. Is there anything you can do to possibly pass? Yes!
It’s your lucky day: There are 100 points of “extra” credit for you to earn, all enumerated above:
three projects, production problems, and participation. You can do it, champ! Earn those points!
