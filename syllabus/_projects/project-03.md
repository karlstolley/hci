requirements:
  - heading: Testing Requirements
    requirements:
      - >
        For each round of testing, you must test with three users who are **not** currently enrolled
        in ITMD 362
      - >
        Each round of testing should test a different group of users: if someone was a test user
        for the first round, you cannot ask them to participate in the second round
      - You must receive a consent form signed physically or digitally by each of your test users
      - >
        You must document each user in each round of testing. That should include at least an
        over-the-shoulder video recording, and might also include a screen recording
      - >
        Users should use their own devices for the test, if at all possible. Strive to test each
        user on a different device (e.g., one on a phone, one on a tablet/touchscreen, one on a
        laptop or desktop machine)
  - heading: Test-Documentation Requirements
    requirements:
      - >
        Preserve all videos of user tests in Google Drive, along with the user consent forms
      - >
        Plan to delete all user-test videos on May 18, 2022 or as soon as possible after that date
  - heading: Implementation Requirements
    requirements:
      - >
        The results from the first round of user testing should lead to specific changes on your
        team's Project Two
      - >
        Keep notes on the changes your team implemented based on the first round of testing; you
        will write about those changes in your memo with Project Two
  - heading: Usability-Report Requirements
    requirements:
      - >
        The results from the second round of user testing will lead to a brief usability report,
        outlining the changes that should be made to further improve your online store
      - >
        The report should be jointly authored as a Markdown file in its own GitHub repository in
        your team’s GitHub organization where you have your Project Two repository
      - >
        You and your team members should all contribute to the report via pull requests
      - >
        Note that you do NOT need to implement the changes; you need only to report them as future
        improvements

  - action: Complete first round of usability testing.

The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s online store from Project Two to
two rounds of user testing, and to implement and report improvements to the project based on what
you learn through your user tests.

You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book. You are welcome to
use as a starting point the [sample script and recording release
form](http://sensible.com/download-files/) available at Krug’s website. However, your script must be
modified to match your specific project and its tasks, obviously.

For each round of tests, you must document users' interactions with your online store. That
documentation is both for reference and for the benefit of your team members who may not be able to
attend the test session live.

Note that this project overlaps with Project Two, which should incorporate improvements from your
first round of user tests.
